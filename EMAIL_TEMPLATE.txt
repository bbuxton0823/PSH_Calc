Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a new tool that will make PSH (Permanent Supportive Housing) rent calculations much easier and more accurate for our team.

🎯 WHAT IT IS:
A professional desktop application that calculates PSH rent assistance following HUD guidelines. It works completely offline with Excel - no internet required!

✨ KEY BENEFITS:
• Simple form interface (no complex spreadsheets to manage)
• Automatic calculation validation and error checking  
• Professional Excel reports ready for case files
• Handles mixed families with automatic proration
• Warns about FMR violations requiring supervisor approval
• Works offline - no cloud storage or security concerns

📥 HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Download the attached ZIP file
2. Extract all files to a folder (like Desktop/PSH-Calculator)  
3. Double-click "setup.py" to install automatically
4. Start using with "start_calculator.bat" (Windows) or "start_calculator.sh" (Mac/Linux)

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS:

• Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

📋 FIRST TIME SETUP:
After installation, go to the "Settings" tab to update FMR (Fair Market Rent) rates for our local area. The app includes complete user documentation and help.
